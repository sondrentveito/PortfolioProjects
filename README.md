# PortfolioProjects

Welcome! I'm a dedicated data enthusiast who will soon graduate with a Master of Business, majoring in Business Data Analytics. I have a strong foundation in analysing complex datasets and extracting valuable insights to drive strategic decision-making. I also gained experience in statistical and performance analysis and data management, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

Alongside my passion for data analysis, I have a penchant for continuous learning and expanding my skill set. When I'm not busy exploring new tools and techniques, you can find me engaging in various activities to keep a well-rounded lifestyle. From staying active and working out to playing football and exploring new destinations, I embrace the balance between professional growth and personal enjoyment.

With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to continuous learning, I enthusiastically approach every project in front of me, whether working independently or with my team. I thrive on the challenges of uncovering patterns, identifying trends, and translating raw data into actionable insights that make a real impact.

Let's collaborate, innovate, and unlock the power of data to drive meaningful outcomes. I'm excited to connect and embark on this transformative adventure!

**Nashville Housing Data - Data Cleaning**

Code: [Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql](https://github.com/sondrentveito/PortfolioProjects/blob/f6cea26536c1f40c0f529ab5e64c08cf50baa357/HousingData_DataCleaning.sql)

Description: This SQL portfolio project focuses on a dataset comprising the sale records of houses in Nashville from 2013 to 2019. The project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and manipulation using MySQL, where I applied various techniques to enhance the dataset's quality and usability.First, I standardized the date format, ensuring consistency across the entire dataset. Additionally, I addressed any empty values within the dataset by updating them with relevant information, ensuring a complete and accurate representation of the sales records.

In order to enrich the dataset's insights, I utilized self-joins to connect and analyze related columns. This allowed me to extract valuable information and establish connections between different parts of the dataset.Furthermore, I employed string splitting techniques to break down relevant columns into meaningful components. This enabled me to extract valuable details that were previously embedded within larger string fields.

Through the application of CASE statements, I performed data transformations to derive additional insights from the dataset. This allowed me to create new calculated fields based on specific conditions, facilitating further analysis and interpretation of the data. Lastly, I utilized appropriate methods to remove any duplicate records, ensuring that the dataset remained clean and free from redundant entries.

Skills: DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

Technology: MySQL

**MongoDB (NoSQL) IMDb Data Analysis and Management**

In this project, I embarked on a journey to harness the power of MongoDB Compass for the structured organization and in-depth analysis of IMDb movie data. The primary objective was to create a robust database system that stores and facilitates advanced analytical operations on movie titles and their corresponding ratings. The project encapsulated a comprehensive exploration of MongoDB functionalities, from the initial stages of database and collection creation to the intricate tasks of schema validation and data importation. Furthermore, I delved deep into schema analysis, extracting meaningful insights about the characteristics of the stored data. The pinnacle of this endeavour was the advanced data aggregation tasks, where I unearthed specific trends and patterns, such as the popularity of Fantasy-Adventure movies in 2021. This project stands as a testament to my proficiency in database management and data analytics using MongoDB Compass.

**R Small Project**

In this assignment, I'm venturing into the realm of data analysis with a focus on the ongoing global health challenge: COVID-19. Using the R programming language, a powerful tool for data manipulation and statistical analysis, I'm tasked with organizing, preparing, and examining datasets related to COVID-19's impact in India. The datasets encompass general case statistics, vaccination details, and statewise testing specifics. As a precursor to the analytical tasks, the assignment guides me through the foundational steps of setting up my work environment, ensuring I have the right tools and libraries at my disposal, and familiarizing myself with the data. This groundwork sets the stage for deeper exploration and insights into India's fight against the pandemic.
